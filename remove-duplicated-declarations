ext4: remove duplicated declarations in inode.c

From: Zheng Liu <wenqing.lz@taobao.com>

In patch cb20d5188366f04d96d2e07b1240cc92170ade40, ext4_set_bh_endio
and ext4_end_io_buffer_write are declared at the beginning of inode.c,
and again later on in the middle of the file.  Remove the second set
of duplicated function declarations.
