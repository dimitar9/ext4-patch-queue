jbd2: commit as soon as possible after log_start_commit

Once a transaction has been requested to be committed, don't let any
other handles start under that transaction, and don't allow any
pending transactions to be extended (i.e., in the case of
unlink/ftruncate).

The idea is once the transaction has had log_start_commit() called on
it, at least one thread is blocked waiting for that transaction to
commit, and over time, more and more threads will end up getting
blocked.  In order to avoid high variability in file system operations
getting blocked behind the a blocked start_this_handle(), we should
try to get the commit started as soon as possible.
