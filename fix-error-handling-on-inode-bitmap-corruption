ext4: fix error handling on inode bitmap corruption

From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

When insert_inode_locked() fails in ext4_new_inode() it most likely means inode
bitmap got corrupted and we allocated again inode which is already in use. Also
doing unlock_new_inode() during error recovery is wrong since the inode does
not have I_NEW set. Fix the problem by jumping to fail: (instead of fail_drop:)
which declares filesystem error and does not call unlock_new_inode().
