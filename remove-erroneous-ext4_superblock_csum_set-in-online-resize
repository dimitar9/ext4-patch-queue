ext4: remove erroneous ext4_superblock_csum_set() in update_backups()

From: Tao Ma <boyu.mt@taobao.com>

The update_backups() function is used to backup all the metadata
blocks, so we should not take it for granted that 'data' is pointed to
a super block and use ext4_superblock_csum_set to calculate the
checksum there.  In case where the data is a group descriptor block,
it will corrupt the last group descriptor, and then e2fsck will
complain about it it.

As all the metadata checksums should already be OK when we do the
backup, remove the wrong ext4_superblock_csum_set and it should be
just fine.
